# Best Performance Practices

This guide will help you to improve the performance your Shiki usage.

## Cache the Highlighter Instance

The highlighter instance is expensive to create. Most of the time, you should create the highlighter instance once and reuse it for multiple highlight operations (singleton pattern).

For example:

```ts
import { createHighlighterCore } from 'shiki/core'

const highlighterPromise = createHighlighterCore({ /* ... */ })

export async function highlightCode(code: string, lang: string) {
  const highlighter = await highlighterPromise
  return highlighter.codeToHtml(code, lang)
}
```

When you no longer need a highlighter instance, you can call `dispose()` method to release the resources. (It can't not be GC-ed automatically, you need to do it explicitly)

```ts
highlighter.dispose()
```

## Fine-Grained Bundle

The pre-built bundles are for easy usage, and mostly intended for Node.js environment where you don't worry too much about the bundle size. If you are building a web application, or in a resource-constrained environment, it's always better to use the fine-grained bundles to reduce the bundle size and memory usage.

**Avoid importing `shiki`, `shiki/bundle/full`, `shiki/bundle/web` directly**.

Instead, import the fine-grained modules like `shiki/core`, `shiki/engine/javascript`, `@shikijs/langs/typescript`, `@shikijs/themes/dark-plus`, etc.

```ts
import { createHighlighterCore } from 'shiki/core'
import { createJavaScriptRegexEngine } from 'shiki/engine/javascript'

const highlighter = await createHighlighterCore({
  themes: [
    import('@shikijs/themes/nord'),
    import('@shikijs/themes/dark-plus'),
    // ...
  ],
  langs: [
    import('@shikijs/langs/typescript'),
    import('@shikijs/langs/javascript'),
    // ...
  ],
  engine: createJavaScriptRegexEngine()
})
```

To compose the fine-grained bundles easily, we also provide the [`shiki-codegen`](/integrations/codegen) tool to generate the fine-grained bundles for you.

Learn more about [Fine-Grained Bundles](/guides/bundles#fine-grained-bundle).

## Use Shorthands

`createHighlighter` and `createHighlighterCore` will load all the themes and languages upfront to ensure the subsequent highlight operations are synchronous. This can add a significant overhead to the startup time specially when you have a lot of themes and languages.

```ts
import { codeToHtml } from 'shiki'

// Only `javascript` and `nord` will be loaded when calling `codeToHtml`
const html = await codeToHtml('const a = 1', {
  lang: 'javascript',
  theme: 'nord'
})
```

You can also create your own shorthands with fine-grained bundles. Check out the [Create Shorthands with Fine-Grained Bundles](/guide/shorthands#create-shorthands-with-fine-grained-bundles) section for more details.

## JavaScript Engine and Pre-compiled Languages

Shiki provides [two engines](/guide/regex-engines) for executing Regular Expressions: [`JavaScript`](/guide/regex-engines#javascript-regexp-engine) and [`Oniguruma`](/guide/regex-engines#oniguruma-engine). The Oniguruma engine is a WebAssembly-based that compiled from C++ code, and `JavaScript` is a pure JavaScript engine that translates Oniguruma-flavored regex to JavaScript regex.

If you are bundling Shiki for the web, using the JavaScript engine would be smaller in bundle size and faster in startup time. Meanwhile, the [precompiled languages](/guide/regex-engines#pre-compiled-languages) can also reduce the bundle size and startup time, if your target browsers support the latest RegExp features.

## Use Workers

Shiki hightlights the code using Regular Expressions, which can be CPU-intensive. You can offload the highlighting work to a Web Worker/Node Worker to avoid blocking the main thread.
